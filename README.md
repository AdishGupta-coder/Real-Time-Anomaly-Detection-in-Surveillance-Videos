### Mid Term Report :
Week 3 assignment - pedestrian_detector.ipynb

I am touring Malaysia in the last week of June and also would be attending the School of Computing Summer Workshop at NUS, Singapore on campus during first 3 weeks of July. This month, I was also working on a research project under Prof. Sudarshan Vijay and has considerable workload. Hence, I would be uploading my final submission for the Week 3 assignment (Midterm Report) on or soon after 30th June 2025. I kindly request WnCC's and mentor's consideration.
