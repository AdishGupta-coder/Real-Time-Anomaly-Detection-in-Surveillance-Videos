# Real Time Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos

### Till now, I have learnt the following in this project:
1. Numpy, Matplotlib, Fundamentals of Python
2. Neural Networks, CNN, OpenCV
3. Object Detection and YOLOv5

### Mid Term Report :
Week 3 assignment - pedestrian_detector.ipynb

I am touring Malaysia during the last week of June and will also be attending the School of Computing Summer Workshop at NUS, Singapore, on campus during the first three weeks of July. Additionally, I have been working on a research project under Prof. Sudarshan Vijay this month, which carries a considerable workload. Due to these commitments, I will be uploading my final submission for the Week 3 assignment (Midterm Report) on or shortly after 30th June 2025. I kindly request WnCC's and my mentorâ€™s consideration regarding this delay.
