# Real-life-Anomaly-Detection

This project under SoC, deploys an Anomaly Algorithm (Unsupervised) to detect distinct pedestrian behaviour in surveillance footages.

## What All I Have Learned

- **CNN and Its Implementation**
  - Learned how convolution, padding, and strided convolution work. Also explored notations in CNN.

- **Filters and Pooling**
  - Learned to apply filters and pooling layers along the RGB channels.

- **OpenCV**
  - Learned the basics of image manipulation using the OpenCV library and working on webcam and video as well.

- **YOLOv5**
  - Learned sliding window detection and its disadvantages.
  - Learned the concept of overlapping and I/O ratio.
  - Learned anchor boxes.
  - Learned the YOLOv5 mechanism.

- **Implementing YOLOv5 on MOT17 Pedestrian Dataset**
  - Implemented YOLOv5 model (small, medium, and medium with frozen layers) on the dataset.
  - Used YOLOv5 trained model and basic anomaly detection techniques to observe anomalies across the test avenues data provided by CUHK.
